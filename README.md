# infinite-monkies
This was my project for the first year module known as CS171, or Computer systems
We worked with a programming language known as processing(this particular project was developed in processing 4)
The concept behind this project is the good old joke theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#:~:text=The%20infinite%20monkey%20theorem%20states,an%20infinite%20number%20of%20times. , 
stating given an infinite amount of time and an infinite amount of monkeys typing, they can theoretically generate any work of text fiction
This "calculator" i suppose will give you the probability chance of the text being generated, it then also attempts to simulate 3 monkeys trying to type the text
granted with the accurate variables it can very time consuming

To compensate for this nearly every variable can changed to accomidate a near infinite amount of functions
